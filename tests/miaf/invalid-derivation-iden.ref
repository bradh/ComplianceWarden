===== Involved rules descriptions:

[heif][Rule #4] Section 6.6.2.1
A derived image item of the item_type value 'iden' (identity transformation)
may be used when it is desired to use transformative properties to derive
an image item. The derived image item shall have no item body (i.e. no extents)
and reference_count for the 'dimg' item  reference of a 'iden' derived image
item shall be equal to 1.

[heif][Rule #6] Section 6.6.2.3.1
Tiles: the values of to_item_ID [shall] identify the input images

[heif][Rule #32] Section 10.2
when a brand specified in ‎10.2 is among the compatible brands of a file,
the requirements specified in Clause ‎6 shall be obeyed

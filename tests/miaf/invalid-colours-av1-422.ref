===== Involved rules descriptions:

[miaf][Rule #38] Section 7.3.11.4.2
Any grid image in a MIAF file shall also conform to the following constraints:
- The tile_width shall be greater than or equal to 64, and should be a multiple
  of 64.
- The tile_height shall be greater than or equal to 64, and should be a multiple
  of 64

[miaf][Rule #40] Section 7.3.6.7
Clean aperture:- when the image is 4:2:2 the horizontal cropped offset and width shall be
  even numbers and the vertical values shall be integers
- when the image is 4:2:0 both the horizontal and vertical cropped offsets and
widths shall be even numbers

[miaf][Rule #42] Section 7.3.11.4.1
The tile size is restricted according to the chroma sampling format of the
input images; the cropping shall select an integer number of samples for
all planes, and result in an output image that also includes an integer number
of samples for all planes

===== Involved rules descriptions:

[av1hdr10plus][Rule #1] Section 2.1
An HDR10+ Metadata OBU is defined as HDR10+ Metadata carried in a Metadata OBU.
The metadata_type of such Metadata OBU is set to METADATA_TYPE_ITUT_T35 and the
itu_t_t35_country_code of the corresponding Metadata ITUT T35 element is set to 0xB5.
The remaining syntax element of Metadata ITUT T35, itu_t_t35_payload_bytes,
is interpreted using the syntax defined in Annex S of [CTA-861], starting with
the itu_t_t35_terminal_provider_code, and the semantics defined in [ST-2094-40].
According to the definition of the HDR10+ Metadata, the first 6 bytes ofthe itu_t_t35_payload_bytes of the HDR10+ Metadata OBU are set as follows:
 - 0x003C, which corresponds to itu_t_t35_terminal_provider_code from Annex S of [CTA-861]
 - 0x0001, which corresponds to itu_t_t35_terminal_provider_oriented_code from Annex S of [CTA-861]
 - 0x4, which corresponds to application_identifier from Annex S of [CTA-861]
 - 0x1, which corresponds to application_mode from Annex S of [CTA-861]

[av1hdr10plus][Rule #9] id: assert-45af0987
Section 2.2.2
for each frame with show_frame = 1 or show_existing_frame = 1, there shall be one
and only one HDR10+ metadata OBU preceding the Frame Header OBU for this frame and
located after the last OBU of the previous frame (if any) or after the
Sequence Header OBU (if any) or after the start of the temporal unit

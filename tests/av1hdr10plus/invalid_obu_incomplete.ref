===== Involved rules descriptions:

[av1hdr10plus][Rule #2] Section 2.2.1
Streams shall use the following values for the AV1 color_config:
 - color_primaries = 9 ([BT-2020])
 - transfer_characteristics = 16 ([SMPTE-ST-2084] / [BT-2100])
 - matrix_coefficients = 9 ([BT-2020])
Additionally, the following recommendations apply:
 - VideoFullRangeFlag should be set to 0
 - subsampling_x and subsampling_y should be set to 0
 - mono_chrome should be 0
 - chroma_sample_position should be set to 2

[av1hdr10plus][Rule #3] Section 2.2.2
for each frame with show_frame=1 or show_existing_frame=1, there shall be one
and only one HDR10+ metadata OBU preceding the frame header for this frame and
located after the last OBU of the previous frame (if any) or after the
Sequence Header (if any) or after the start of the temporal unit (e.g. after the
temporal delimiter, for storage formats where temporal delimiters are preserved).
